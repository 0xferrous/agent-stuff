- Always keep the readme up to date as code changes are made
- Keep the readme concise and to point
- New extensions must be written in this repo at `./extensions/`
- New skills must be written in this repo at `./skills/`
- I prefer nushell for scripts
- prefer `nix-shell` as shebang with explicit dependency declaration
